Goals
- Team: Complete the project well
- Individual: Do/score well (everyone)
- Obstacles: Bugs, design challenges
- Decision on A grade: talk about it
- Second decision: talk about it 

Meetings
- Class time: update on changes, ask TA about bugs or questions, assign responsibilities, work on the code
- Meetings outside class time: on a need-to-know basis (text, call, Zoom, in-person, etc.)
- Communication: text, call

Work
- Time: equivalent to a pset 
- Division of work: on project handout (2 tasks per person for iteration #1, 4 tasks per person for iteration #0)
- Recording responsibilities: on project handout, make another txt file
- Per week: have some task completed by check-in
- Fall through on commitment: text beforehand for awareness
- Review: during check-ins, comments on the code
- Not doing share: tell them, text/talk about how to resolve the issue
- Different work habits: will not cut too close to the deadline

Decision Making
- Consensus: don't need 100% consensus but talk about it if it's a big change
- Fixating: tell them that they're fixating/talk about it, correctness/feasibility is a big factor
