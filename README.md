### Sequence (h's Version)
An online multiplayer version of the board game Sequence

Rules:
TBA

Notes for future me:
* i think hardcoding the board(s) would be better? def not gonna server it
* ^ means boards & lib will probs be deleted; should edit json to match
* seperate internal rep vs drawing it vs client
* i think a state machine might work, rather than async? look into it tho
* will github page automatically run w typescript? aka no need to run client, etc?
* ^ how's that work for multiplayer?? research
* try single player version first, up to 3 people ig? then later implement team version
